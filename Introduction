For this problem, I would like to make a recommendation to open a new store for a chain restaurant in New York.
I'll give the recommendation based on the target customer of the chain restaurant--whether it is an economic 
restaurant or a high- end one, the maximum customer that the restaurant can serve every day, whether potential
competitor exists in the neighborhood, etc. 

The system that is going to be developedwill provide the recommendation of the potential site that gives
the chain restaurant the maximum profit and gain competitive advantages in the community. 



I will use the API from Foursquare to generate the data I need, like the kind of foods served in the nearby restaurants,
the market size of the neighborhood, the rating of the competitors and so on. Perhaps I will use other data sources like 
the socioeconomic data published by the NYC government if needed. 

Based on these data, I will try to figure out an algorithm to consider them comprehensively to form the recommendation
given to the chain restaurant.
